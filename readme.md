# Acme PIM v0.1 ðŸš€ 

Showcasing a variety of OOP-wise design patterns, this repository is an academic exercise demonstrating a simple implementation of a product information management system (PIM).
It presents the C++ 17 code files for a command-line application that manages a database of products and categories. 

## Core functionalities:
- **A modular library for terminal-based user interfaces**
- **Database in SQLite**
- **An Abstract Data Type (ADT) class for**
  - *Product Management and Persistence*
    - Create, update, delete, and query products with attributes like name, SKU, description, price, and category.
  - *Category Management and Persistence*
    - Add, modify, delete, and visualize categories.
  - **Custom Attributes and Variants**
    - Flexible definition of product attributes (e.g., color, size) and management of product variants.
